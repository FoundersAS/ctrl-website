      This post aims to map out the current battles we must win, to re-establish and maintain an open and free internet for everyone. It also introduces introduces CTRL, a radically pragmatic approach to data ownership and access. CTRL is building a suite of open source tools that  empower you to store, manage and protect your own data, without any extensive technical experience.Â 

      Our mission is to help everyone reclaim control of their data without having to sacrifice access to the power and conveniences of the internet.
